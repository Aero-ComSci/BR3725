def multiply(a,b):
    '''
    Step 1 = Take a number 'x' and set it to 0
    Step 2 = Create a for loop that iterates 'b' times.
    Step 3 = In each iteration, add 'a' to 'x' so the new value after the first iteration is a, then 2a after second iteration, and so on.
    Step 4 = Return the final value of x.

    #to multiply a number by 2 using bitshift, you just shift the bits 1 to the left, multiplying it by 2^1 or 2.
